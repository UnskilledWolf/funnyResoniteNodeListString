## Added this Fork:
+ Type String generation
  + Format: `TypeName[E]: FriendlyTypeName<FriendlyGenericName>`
+ **Note: edit the .csproj file to point to your Resonate installation**

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Resonite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2519830/Resonite/)

To run the generator yourself, clone the repo and make sure that path to resonite is set inside `standaloneFunnyString.csproj`
then run
```bash
dotnet run
```
This should create a new file `funnystring.txt`

This program is very experimental and is probably barely holding together so if you spot something wrong lmk!
